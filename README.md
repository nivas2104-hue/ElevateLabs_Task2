# Task 2 — Phishing Email Analysis

This repository contains a short phishing email analysis report created as part of a Cyber Security internship task.

## Files
- `Phishing_Email_Analysis_Report.docx` — The analysis report (contains sample text, findings, recommendations, and placeholders for screenshots).
- `screenshots/` — Add your email screenshot(s) and header analysis screenshots here (not included by default).

## How to use
1. Add the screenshots you captured to the `screenshots/` folder (e.g. `email_screenshot.png`, `header_analysis.png`).
2. Review or edit `Phishing_Email_Analysis_Report.docx` if you want to add header analyzer output or extra notes.
3. When ready, push this folder to a new GitHub repository for submission.

## Notes
- The report was generated for the provided sample phishing message:

```
Microsoft 365 Support (support@office-365-notifications.com)
To: john.doe@mybusiness.com
Subject: Security alert
[Recover account]...
```

- If you later retrieve the email headers from a live message, paste them into MXToolbox (https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx) and save a screenshot in `screenshots/header_analysis.png`.

## Contact
If you want, I can also generate a `.pdf` version and push these files into a zipped folder ready for upload. Just tell me which you prefer.
